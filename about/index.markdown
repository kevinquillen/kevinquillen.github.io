I'm Kevin.

I've been around computers since I was 5 years old when we bought a Tandy SL, before the days of Windows. Imagine that, if you will.

I've built websites and applications from the small to the very large. I love it all, from the user stories, to the UX, UI, DX, APIs, and code that pulls it all together.

In my free time, I love to play guitar, read, rile up my hedgehog Roxy, and enjoy a good beer. I'm fortunate enough to live
within walking distance of [Dogfish Head Craft Brewery](http://www.dogfish.com) - so I am never in short supply. I also enjoy
cooking, working on electronics projects, and working around the house.

Collecting vinyl records is something I know virtually nothing about, but I love to pick them up at auctions or antique stores. If you are
or know someone who knows how to restore a Grundig SO-122 stereo tube console, please [contact me](https://twitter.com/kevinquillen)! I would love your help finishing what I
started.

But one of the things I loved doing; the reason you're on this site right now; is writing. I love to write. I've found my voice again,
and hope that you find the things I write about informative, humorous, and for some of you, helpful.

If you want to reach me, it's easiest to catch me on Twitter at [@kevinquillen](https://twitter.com/kevinquillen).
