## Out with the Old

I usually don't do these sorts of posts, you know, ones where you reflect on the year behind you. That's probably because for many years, simply getting through them was a slog and left me feeling exhausted, unaccomplished, and dreading the road ahead.

However, 2015 was so utterly fantastic in ways I hadn't experienced before, that I hope 2016 continues on this track.

## A Promotion

Firstly, my new career is going great. A few months ago, I was officially given the title "Drupal Practice Lead", up from the senior developer position when I was hired. I've been given complete freedom and control to develop guidelines, tools, and best practices for Drupal projects. At the same time, I have been efforting contributed projects to elevate Velir's position in the Drupal space as experts who produce high quality, thoughtful work.

I've had the privilege of working beside and getting to know over 140 coworkers over the course of the year. Constantly being surrounded by people smarter than you allows such room for growth and opportunity, as well as an awareness for being able to realize _what_ you don't know; whether it be code, management, sales, communication or process related.

This experience has helped me better define my worth in regards to what I bring to the table, and what I am capable of doing.

## Drupal Contributions

The [new Velir site](http://www.velir.com) uses two of them, [CodeSnippet](https://drupal.org/project/wysiwyg_codesnippet) and [Neato](https://drupal.org/project/neato).

[CodeSnippet](https://drupal.org/project/wysiwyg_codesnippet) allows content editors to insert code in just about any major language into CKEditor and be highlighted in a color theme of their choosing. [Neato](https://drupal.org/project/neato) is a theme framework based on Neat/Bourbon that our design and front end team use daily. It allowed us to facilitate designs without getting in the way of getting what we wanted, which is usually an obstacle in Drupal theming.

For example, [Neato](https://drupal.org/project/neato) was also used on the [Primary Health Care Performance Initiative](http://www.) website. Since the front end team built a prototype using HTML/Neat/Bourbon, transposing that to Drupal was dead simple. The site, which uses statistical data housed in our own .NET application we call Datacenter, contains visualized graphs in Angular.js and d3.js, right inside of the Drupal theming process.
