Just wanted to drop a quick post about a plugin I came across last week called <a href="https://vimawesome.com/plugin/fzf" target="_blank">fzf</a>.

<a href="https://vimawesome.com/plugin/fzf" target="_blank">fzf</a> is a plugin for the command line that enables fuzzy find searching for a majority of file types in the current working directory. It also has a split pane view for file preview right in terminal, as well as a vim integration.

If you have homebrew, you can install it quickly:

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">
brew install fzf
</code></pre>

This plugin is _awesome_ and belongs in anyones command line toolbox. <a href="https://vimawesome.com/plugin/fzf" target="_blank">Check it out here!</a>
