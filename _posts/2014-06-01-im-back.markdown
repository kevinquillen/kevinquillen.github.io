Yes.

Every now and then, I get an itch to have a new site. Over the years, I became tired of being tied to Wordpress, Octopress and Tumblr.

Finally, thanks to the brilliant people at [GitHub](http://www.github.com) - I am afforded free hosting with GitHub Pages, which leverages
Jekyll to compiled and generate a static site.

I know I maintain the official [Zurb Foundation](https://drupal.org/project/zurb-foundation) implementation for
[Drupal](http://drupal.org), but I chose to use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) for a bit of variety. I feel it best represents my
personality, plus, it's fun and readable on any device.

Let the posts fly.

##### Wait! What are you going to talk about?

Oh, right. Well, mainly code related subjects for both the back and frontend, and sometimes about tools like Git. Since this is what I do every
single day, that's what I'm gonna lay down. Dig it.

##### Also, I don't know you. Or do I?

That's okay. The internet is large and vast, I am just one voice - but if you don't know me, [read on](/about).
