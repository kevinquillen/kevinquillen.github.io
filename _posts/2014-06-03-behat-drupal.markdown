<h3>The Initiation
<br><small>Why you came.</small></h3>

Alright. This is it. You're here because you've heard of this mysterious 'Behat' while searching for best practices in
testing Drupal.

Up through Drupal 7, core and contrib relied on a method of testing leveraging the SimpleTest library. While it has served a
purpose, some of us need a much faster and clearer way of testing. Also, if you're a designer, you're probably looking for a easier
point of entry to not only testing your front or backend UI, but contributing to testing functional (behaviors) pieces of the application. You
may not have the best programming chops, or maybe OOP scares you.

Or simply, *maybe you just need to get shit done without much hassle*.

Writing tests where you look to test behaviors from a user perspective is called **"Behavior Driven Development"**. Adding up multiple
tests together into feature testing forms a solid group of user acceptance tests. When the tests pass, you know you are facilitating the
user stories of the features you were asked to implement. You don't have to go back to your QA team or project manager and say "okay I'm done"
and wait for them to click around for hours and tell you things are still missing.

#### Wait, so Behat is... ?

From the official Behat site:

>Behat is a tool that makes behavior driven development (BDD) possible. With BDD, you write human-readable stories that describe the behavior of your application. These stories can then be auto-tested against your application. And yes, itâ€™s as cool as it sounds!

Your OOP skills to work with other testing suites may be rusty or non-existent. But everyone is able to write and understand basic descriptive sentences.

#### Right... but what is Behat really?

[Behat](http://behat.org/) is a PHP implementation of the Gherkin language, which powered [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/) for Ruby. It provides a way to tell the system in plain English how to go about
testing your feature points *as if it were the user doing it*. Not only is this a great way to automate tests, it cuts down hours of tedious
clicking by a human to say that something is working or not. Human testing is also highly unreliable for building confidence in the
functional stability of a whole application.

#### I think I understand... can I have a real world example?

Let's take the simplest user test we can think of in Drupal. A site administrator should be able to create and edit page content. Now, you should know how to
do this in Drupal manually, it's very straightforward. But, let's get Behat to do it for us, and tell us the results:

<pre class="language-markup"><code class="language-gherkin">
Feature: Content Management
  When I log into the website
  As an administrator
  I should be able to create, edit, and delete page content

  Scenario: An administrative user should be able create page content
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "administrator" role
    When I go to "node/add/page"
    Then I should not see "Access denied"
</code></pre>

Now, we execute Behat from the command line:

<pre class="language-markup">
<code class="language-bash">
vendor/bin/behat

..................

1 scenarios (1 passed)
3 steps (3 passed)
0m1.398s
</code>
</pre>

Bingo! Your first test. Not only does this serve as an example, it's a real useful test as well. More importantly, it took about a second total to
 run this test.

#### That sounds great, but it probably can't test Javasc-

Yes, it can. With the additional Selenium2 driver, you can test front end interactions like AJAX events or filling out a form just as easy.

Try to contain your excitement. I couldn't believe it either until I saw it happen. But seeing is believing, so lets get ready.

<h3>Setting up your machine
<br><small>Okay, there <em>may</em> be a few dragons here. Let's slay them.</small></h3>

This post is from a perspective of a developer (me) running virtualized environments with Vagrant. If you don't use Vagrant, you probably won't
be able to follow along very well. For that, my heart goes out to you, but do consider switching - it's an exceptional tool. For you Windows
folks... wish I could help you too.

#### What you'll need

- OSX 1.7+ or modern flavor of Linux
- Homebrew or other package management tool
- Composer
- An IDE (I live and die by [PHPStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/))
- Terminal/command line access

#### What we'll be using

- Vagrant LAMP box
- Behat
- Mink
- [Drupal Behat Extension](http://dspeak.com/drupalextension/intro.html)

The [Drupal Behat Extension](http://dspeak.com/drupalextension/intro.html) is what kicked off my entire foray into the world of Behat.

With the extension, it adds lots of prebuilt step definitions for you that are ready to use. A step definition is what Behat uses to evaluate
your expressions, and we will look at those in a little bit.

First, if you have a Vagrant LAMP stack going, great. If not, you may want to grab one. There are many online to pick from or you can make
your own box setup at [PuPHPet](https://puphpet.com/). I don't want to get into the nitty gritty of setting up Vagrant itself - there are
already many posts on the subject. Everything we have will run on Vagrant which is tuned to be just like our production environments on our
host server.

##### Append your Vagrantfile

One thing we need to do is append the end of your Vagrantfile to execute a shell script. This script will setup the necessary packages
needed on the virtual machine to run Selenium tests.

##### Install Composer

Secondly, install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is what will bring the necessary third party
PHP libraries together so we can run tests. Install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) globally so it can be run from any directory.

Once you have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed, we need to provide a simple composer.json file telling it what libraries
we need.

<pre class="language-markup">
<code class="language-javascript">
{
  "name": "YOURNAME/PROJECTNAME",
  "description": "PROJECTNAME",
  "require": {
    "behat/mink": "1.5.*@stable",
    "behat/mink-goutte-driver": "*",
    "behat/mink-selenium2-driver": "*",
    "drupal/drupal-extension": "*"
  }
}
</code>
</pre>

This file should sit in the root of your project (outside of the docroot). Next, we are going to tell Composer to fetch and install these
packages.

In terminal:

<pre class="language-markup">
<code class="language-bash">
composer install
</code>
</pre>

That's it! It will process and download the libraries to a new 'vendor' folder. Add this folder to your .gitignore - it's not something you
want to have version controlled.

##### Configure Behat

Now, we need to create a simple config file for Behat. Create a file in your project root and name it 'behat.yml'.

Inside of the behat.yml file, paste in this basic config:

<pre class="language-markup">
<code class="language-javascript">
default:
  context:
    class: 'FeatureContext'
  paths:
    features: 'features'
    bootstrap: 'features/bootstrap'
  extensions:
    Behat\MinkExtension\Extension:
      goutte: ~
      javascript_session: selenium2
      selenium2:
        wd_host: http://VHOST_SERVER_ALIAS:4444/wd/hub
      base_url: http://VHOST_SERVER_ALIAS
    Drupal\DrupalExtension\Extension:
      blackbox: ~
      api_driver: 'drupal'
      drupal:
        drupal_root: '/path/to/your/project/docroot'
</code>
</pre>

Above, replace VHOST_SERVER_ALIAS with your local development URL. If your local URL is <code>local.mysite.com</code>, enter that. This hooks up
the Selenium driver and enables it to browse and talk to your site.
